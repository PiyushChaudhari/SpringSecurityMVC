Spring Security Permission Based framework.


This application demonstrate how to use spring security in spring mvc application. This is java config based configuration. I tried to implement following customization on spring security framework.

1) Custom Authentication Provider.
2) Custom UserDetailsService.
3) Custom LoginSuccessHandler
4) Custom AuthenticationFailureHandler
5) Custom AccessDecisionVoter
6) Update Current LoggedIn UserDetails
7) Display All LoggedIn User In Application.
8) Custom taglib to show/hide action based on user's role and permission.
9) Prevent multiple login for same user (spring security concurrent user login prevention).
10) Override spring security message as custome message.
